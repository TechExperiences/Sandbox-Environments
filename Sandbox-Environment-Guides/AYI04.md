# Post deployment Guide - Work IQ

The third component of the accelerator — Work IQ (the Copilot Studio email-triggered agent that orchestrates Fabric IQ and Foundry IQ from a single conversational ingress)

### Steps need to be performed:

- **Import the solution:** Import the Power Platform zip solution file inside the solution file folder into your Power Platform environment
- **Configure connections:** Sign in to and authorize the Work IQ, Microsoft Teams, Copilot Studio, Office 365 Outlook, Fabric Data Agent, and Foundry Agent connections. 
- **Configure the email trigger** in the Power Automate flow — select the target inbox/folder to monitor and (optionally) add a subject filter such as IQ Request.
- **Publish the agent** in Copilot Studio and enable the Microsoft Teams channel.

## Step 0: Create a Power Platoform Environment with Dataverse enabled

1. Right click on the [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com) link then **Copy link** and then paste it on your VM browser tab.

## Step 1: Import the Solution and configure the connections.

In this step, you will import the Power Platform zip solution file into your Power Platform environment.

1. Navigate back to **Power Apps** portal.

1. Click on the **default Environment (1)** and then select your **Amplify Environment<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)** Environment.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a50.png)

1. Make sure your in your **Amplify Environment<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** Environment.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a51.png)

1. Go to **Solutions (1)** and then select **Import solution (2)**.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a52.png)

1. Click on **Browse** to select the solution file to import.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a53.png)

1. Navigate to **C:\Files (1)**, then select **MicrosoftIQAccelerator (2)** zip file and then **Open (3)**.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a54.png)

1. Once the Solution file is imported, click on **Next**.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a55.png)

1. Click on **Next** again.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a56.png)

1. Make sure you signed in / green check mark is showing up for all the services **(1)** and then **Import (2)**.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a57.png)

1. Wait for the Solution to import successfully.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a58.png)

1. After importing has completed, click **Publish all customizations** in the top menu.    

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a59.png)

1. Wait for publishing to complete. 

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a60.png)

1. When the import is complete, the solution will be available in the environment.

## Step 2: Configure the Email Trigger

Once connections are set, configure the Power Automate flow to monitor the correct inbox:

1. Navigate to **Solutions (1)** then select the imported **Microsoft IQ Accelerator (2)** solution.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a61.png)

1. Select the **When a new email arrives (V3)** trigger.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a62.png)

1. Click on **Edit**.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a63.png)

1. Click on **When a new email arrives (V3)** trigger.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a64.png)

1. Delete the **Inbox** folder.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a65.png)

1. Once it is deleted, click on the **folder (1)** icon and then select the **Inbox (2)** again. We deleted and selected the folder again because `Even though the Folder field shows 'Inbox,' this solution was imported from a different environment, so it may still be pointing at the wrong mailbox behind the scenes. Delete the value and re-select 'Inbox' from the picker to force it to re-link to your own mailbox.`

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a66.png)

1. Expand the **Show advanced options** drop down.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a67.png)

1. Click the **X **next to that email address to remove it entirely, it is a stale leftover from wherever this solution was originally built/tested. 

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a68.png)

1. Optionally add a `Subject Filter` to limit which emails trigger the flow (e.g., **IQ Request (1)**) and then **Save (2)** the flow.   

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a69.png)

## Step 3: Add the External Agents in Copilot Studio   

After import, add the Fabric and Foundry agents again in Copilot Studio. Use Fabric for data questions and Foundry for document questions. If they do not appear yet, finish deploying Fabric and Foundry first, then return to Copilot Studio and refresh the agent list.

### Step 2: Send a Test Email

Send an email to trigger the agent. Use the below example scenarios that test both data retrieval (Fabric) and knowledge base search (Foundry):

#### Example: Supply Chain Disruption

1. Right click on [Outlook](https://outlook.com/) then **Copy link** and and then paste it on your VM browser tab to open **Outlook**.

1. Click on **Continue**.

      ```
      Hi Team,

      I just received notification that our primary camping tent supplier, 
      Mountain Peak Manufacturing, is experiencing production delays due to 
      material shortages. This could impact our inventory levels significantly.

      Can you provide:
      1. Current inventory levels for all tent products from this supplier
      2. Our alternative supplier options based on our supplier qualification policy
      3. Recommended actions to mitigate supply chain risk

      This is urgent as we're heading into peak season.

      Thanks,
      [Your Name]
      ```

      - Click **Send (4)**

      ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a110.png)

### Step 3: Monitor the Flow

After sending the email:

1. Navigate to **Power Automate**.

1. Click on the **default Environment (1)** and then select **Amplify Environment<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)** to switch the environment.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a111.png)

1. Navigate to **My flows (1)** and then click on **When a new email arrives (v3) (2)**.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a112.png)

1. Within 1-2 minutes, a new flow run should appear in Power Automate's run history (if monitoring). Click on it.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a113.png)

1. Typical execution time: 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Status should progress from **Running** to **Succeeded**

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a114.png)

### Step 4: Review Response in Teams

1. Within 1-3 minutes of sending the email, you should receive a message from the agent in Teams. Navigate back to **Teams**.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a115.png)

1. The response should look similar to this. Including detials regarding the triggered mail.
