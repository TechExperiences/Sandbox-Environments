# 2. Rapid Prototyping


Now that you have completed the envisioning **Whiteboard session** and identified key business opportunities, it is time to move from ideas to a working prototype. Explore how a prebuilt intelligent solution can bring the envisioned scenario to life, validate its potential, and demonstrate how it could work in practice.

## Rapid Prototyping using GitHub Copilot

You will use GitHub Copilot to generate ARM or Bicep templates from the created Future State Architecture of Whiteboard.

- **ARM templates:** JSON-based Infrastructure-as-Code files used to define and deploy Azure resources.
- **Bicep templates:** Simplified, declarative Infrastructure-as-Code files used to define and deploy Azure resources with cleaner syntax.

   Please follow these below instructions for Fabric IQ section:
   1. List down all the Azure resources from the architecture diagram.
   2. Crate a new resource group and new Fabric Workspace(SKU F16) for WestUS3 region 
   3. Create Dashboards
   3. Create Lakehouse and store sample data into tables(Tables should be as per architecture design)
   4. Create Fabric Ontology using above Lakehouse tables with proper relationship and generate Ontology Graph View
   5. Create Data Agent using above Ontology as a data source and prepare proper Agent Instruction based on these Ontology Entities.
   Note: After complete all above steps successfully, create MD(mark down) file with deployment instructions and post deployment configurations, and start deployment(create workspace, create lakehouse, table creation, sample data insertion, ontology creation, data agent creation)
   ```

   - Then **Send (3)**.
