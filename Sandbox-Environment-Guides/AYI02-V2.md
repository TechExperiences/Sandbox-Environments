# 2. Rapid Prototyping


Now that you have completed the envisioning **Whiteboard session** and identified key business opportunities, it is time to move from ideas to a working prototype. Explore how a intelligent solution can bring the envisioned scenario to life, validate its potential, and demonstrate how it could work in practice.

## Rapid Prototyping using GitHub Copilot

You will use GitHub Copilot to generate ARM or Bicep templates using the Future State Architecture arrived at from the previous Whiteboarding exercise.

- **ARM templates:** JSON-based Infrastructure-as-Code files used to define and deploy Azure resources.
- **Bicep templates:** Simplified, declarative Infrastructure-as-Code files used to define and deploy Azure resources with cleaner syntax.

## Work IQ

The third component of the accelerator — Work IQ (the Copilot Studio email-triggered agent that orchestrates Fabric IQ and Foundry IQ from a single conversational ingress)

### Steps that need to be performed:

- **Import the solution:** Import the Power Platform zip solution file inside the solution file folder into your Power Platform environment
- **Configure connections:** Sign in to and authorize the Work IQ, Microsoft Teams, Copilot Studio, Office 365 Outlook, Fabric Data Agent, and Foundry Agent connections. 
- **Configure the email trigger** in the Power Automate flow — select the target inbox/folder to monitor and (optionally) add a subject filter such an IQ Request.
- **Publish the agent** in Copilot Studio and enable the Microsoft Teams channel.

### Step 0: Create a Power Platoform Environment with Dataverse enabled

    - **Name:** Enter **Amplify Environment<inject key="Deployment-ID" enableCopy="false"/>** **(2)**
    - Then Scroll down to **Change default settings**

      ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/b77.png)

1. Expand **Change default settings (1)** and then **Turn On (2)** setting **Add a Dataverse data  store?** and then click on **Next (3)**.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a45.png)

1. Then select **Save**.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/b78.png)

1. Please wait until your **Amplify Environment<inject key="Deployment-ID" enableCopy="false"/>** environment is **Ready** before proceeding.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/b80.png)


### Step 1: Import the Solution and configure the connections.

In this step, you will import the Power Platform zip solution file into your Power Platform environment.

1. Navigate back to **Power Apps** portal.

1. Click on the **default Environment (1)** and then select your **Amplify Environment<inject key="Deployment-ID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)** Environment.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a50.png)

1. Make sure you are in your **Amplify Environment<inject key="Deployment-ID" enableCopy="false"/>** Environment.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a51.png)

1. Go to **Solutions (1)** and then select **Import solution (2)**.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a52.png)

1. Click on **Browse** to select the solution file to import.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a53.png)

1. Navigate to **C:\Files (1)**, then select **MicrosoftIQAccelerator (2)** zip file and then **Open (3)**.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a54.png)

1. Once the Solution file is imported, click on **Next**.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a55.png)

1. Click on **Next** again.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a56.png)

1. Make sure you are signed in and a green check mark is showing up for all the services **(1)** and then click on **Import (2)**.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a57.png)

1. Wait for the Solution to import successfully, it may take `2-3 minutes`.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a58.png)

1. After importing has completed, click **Publish all customizations** in the top menu.    

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a59.png)

1. Wait for publishing to complete. 

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a60.png)

1. When the import is complete, the solution will be available in the environment.

### Step 2: Configure the Email Trigger

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a65.png)

1. Once it is deleted, click on the **folder (1)** icon and then select the **Inbox (2)** again. We deleted and selected the folder again because `Even though the Folder field shows 'Inbox,' this solution was imported from a different environment, so it may still be pointing at the wrong mailbox behind the scenes. Delete the value and re-select 'Inbox' from the picker to force it to re-link to your own mailbox.`

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a66.png)

1. Expand the **Show advanced options** drop down.

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a67.png)

1. Click the **X** next to that email address to remove it entirely, it is a stale leftover from wherever this solution was originally built/tested. 

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a68.png)

1. Optionally add a `Subject Filter` to limit which emails trigger the flow. You can provide **IQ Request** **(1)** and then **Save (2)** the flow.   

   ![](../Sandbox-Environment-Guides/Images/a69.png)

### Step 3: Add the External Agents in Copilot Studio

      Hi Team,

      I just received notification that our primary camping tent supplier, 
      Mountain Peak Manufacturing, is experiencing production delays due to 
      material shortages. This could impact our inventory levels significantly.

      Can you provide:
      1. Current inventory levels for all tent products from this supplier
      2. Our alternative supplier options based on our supplier qualification policy
      3. Recommended actions to mitigate supply chain risk

      This is urgent as we're heading into peak season.

      Thanks,
      [Your Name]
      ```

      - Click **Send (4)**
